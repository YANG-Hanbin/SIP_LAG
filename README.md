# SIP_LAG
Code for the paper "On Generating Lagrangian Cuts for Two-Stage Stochastic Integer Programs" (https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2022.1185)

"Results in the paper" were generated using Python 3.6.5 with IP solver Gurobi 8.1.1 for SNIP and SSLP instances and Gurobi 9.0.3 for SSLPV instances

See `runTest.py` for examples of running on SNIP, SSLP and SSLPV instances
